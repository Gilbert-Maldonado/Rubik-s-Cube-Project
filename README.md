# Rubiks-Cube-Project
An Alarm clock that will not turn off unless you put a solved Rubik's cube in front of it. Receives and parses current weather and news information to be spoken using a text-to-speech API when the alarm goes off. API key is not in there and there are jar files that are needed to run this project; get a hold of me if you're wondering what jars you need. :)
